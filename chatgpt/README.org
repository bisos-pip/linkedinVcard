# bisos.linkedin Python Package

## Abstract

The `bisos.linkedin` package automates the process of transforming LinkedIn
export data into enriched vCards, specifically focusing on the first-level
connections present in your LinkedIn data. LinkedIn’s export includes valuable
information about your connections—such as names, job titles, company details,
invitations, and messages—that naturally fits into a contact management system
like vCards. By leveraging this package, you can convert, enrich, and augment
these details into vCards that are readily importable into your preferred usage
environment (e.g., Emacs bbdb, MS Outlook, or any other vCard-compatible
system). This process is repeatable and scalable, making it easier to maintain
an up-to-date contact database, effectively integrating LinkedIn connection data
into your daily workflow.

## Overview

The `bisos.linkedin` Python package is a set of utilities designed to transform
and enrich LinkedIn export data into vCards for your first-level connections.
The package automates the process of creating and augmenting vCards from the
exported LinkedIn data (such as Connections.csv, Invitations.csv, and
messages.csv) by adding local, remote, and external information.

This package enables the creation of rich vCards that contain contact details like names, emails, job titles, and invitation history, based on your LinkedIn export. The tool can also enhance the vCards by extracting additional information from LinkedIn contact pages and external contact enrichment sources.

## Key Features

1. **Local Augmentation**:
   - Augments vCards with data from `Connections.csv`, `Invitations.csv`, and `messages.csv`.
   - For each contact, the invitation status is captured (whether you invited the connection or vice versa) and the invitation message text is added to the vCard.

2. **Remote Augmentation**:
   - Extracts additional details from LinkedIn's Contact Info page via automated scraping, such as email addresses, phone numbers, and other publicly available contact information.

3. **External Augmentation**:
   - Optionally integrates with external services for contact enrichment to further enhance your vCards with data such as job titles, company names, and social profiles.

4. **Seamless vCard Generation**:
   - The tool automatically converts your first-level LinkedIn connections into individual vCard files, using the unique LinkedIn ID as the file name.
   - Output vCards are enriched and ready for import into other systems (e.g., CRM, contacts app).

5. **Command-Line Tools**:
   - The package provides a set of command-line utilities that allow you to:
     - Convert your LinkedIn export CSV files to vCards.
     - Augment vCards with additional information.
     - Extract contact details from LinkedIn profiles automatically.
